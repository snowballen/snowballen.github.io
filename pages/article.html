<h1>Previously Covered Idea Has Now Become A Government Program</h1>
<p class="paragraph1">
In May of last year, we published an article where we discussed one of your ideas. The idea was called “The Fixxer’
Upper Program”. The core of the idea was to use taxpayer money to renovate and revitalize impoverished and beaten-down
residential areas. Well, guess what? That very idea has now become a government program and has already reached over 35
cities in the US!
<br>
<br>
The idea came from reader John Lapkin. Lapkin is not a politician or a policy maker. Lapkin is a regular guy that had a
great idea and wanted to see it through. This just goes to show what kind of change you can make in the world if you
truly want to. After we discussed Lapkin’s idea on the blog, we were approached by someone that works high up in a
relevent government organization. The person reached out to us to get Lapkin’s contact information. Shortly after
sending his contact information over, the process of making this program a reality quickly started.
<br>
<br>
The program focuses specifically on areas that the local government wishes to revitalize for one several reasons:
    The area has a high probability of reaching new heights,
    the area was once filled with life and activity; they now wish to revitalize it, or
    the area has a historical significance

<p class="paragraph2">
    As you can see from the image above, the sorts of houses that are the target for this program has not well-off houses
    that a few new nails or a coat of paint, they are houses that need some serious work. People that live around or below
    the poverty threshold do not have the financial means to focus on renovating or fixing their homes. As Larkin stated in
    his original submission, fixing these kinds of homes will not only make the houses spruce up, but it will also most
    certainly have an effect on the morale and hope that the people in the program will feel.
    <br>
    <br>
    As the program already has reached over 35 cities in the US, it will exciting to see what kinf of change can come about
    in the local communities, resulting from this program. Although the program is very young, the main team behind the
    program have stated that they have seen positive indicators of the program bringing positive ripple effects in certain
    communities.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you have a great idea you would like to share with the world, share it with us! As you can see from Mr. Larkin’s
    example, anyone with a great idea can bring positive change into the world. Simply fill out the “Idea form” on the front
    page of the site, and we will review it as soon as we have the chace. Best regards,
    <br>
    The team at The Hotspot
